# Car or Driver - What wins a championship in Formula 1?
### Data Analysis project using Formula 1 datasets

There's a common belief amongst nostalgic fans of F1 that, in a not-so-far past, everything was so beautiful in the category that a driver could win the Championship by brute force, that is, without the best cars. Nowadays, they say, any idiot with the best car is capable of winning. It's all on the machinery, so there isn't a balance between drivers anymore.

How much is that true? This data analysis is inspired by the Splash and Go F1 podcast's episode on the same topic, where F1 championships were evaluated by season, taking into account Drivers' and Constructors' standings. 

We will not dive in deep on each season's analysis, but in order to manipulate more the datasets, we will evaluate every season (between 1950 and 2020) where the World Drivers Champion's team was not the World Constructors Champion as well. (spoiler: every single season of these has a story to tell!)

The dataset used covers the all seasons between 1950 and 2020, and is available under CC0 license on Kaggle, and can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepshah16/formula-1-19502020">here</a>.
